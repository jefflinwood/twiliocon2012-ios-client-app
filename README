TwilioCon 2012 iPhone Demo app

Requires the Twilio iOS Client SDK

Need to add libTwilioClientSDK.a
Need to add Twilio iOS Client SDK Headers folder to Headers Search Path

Otherwise this won't even compile.

Basic App:
==========
* Gets a capability token asynchronously
* Shows/hides "Logging into Twilio" message
* Enables/disables Dial and Hangup buttons

This app requires a server component that will supply a capability token.
